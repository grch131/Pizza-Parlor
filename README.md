This is our Pizza Parlor Simulation! For the class of INST326

This simulation was inspired by the flash game "Papa's Pizzeria" Our group has decided to do something fun for our final project that incorporates all of the OOP aspects we have learned 
throughout the semester.

The user will be able to make their own personal pizza by asking for the size, and toppings. They will then be able to view how many every pizza's they have ordered, and the cost
of each pizza when they are done ordering.
